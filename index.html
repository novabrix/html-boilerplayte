        <h1>Hello World!- A Quick Story of my Life</h1>
        <h4>Made possible by The Odin Project! Thanks for all you've done for me.</h4>
            <p>Welcome, dear viewer. This is my second <em>ever</em> paragraph I've enshrined in code. Mostly, because I
            avoid things that are hard. I do this too much, and it is a mannerism I am trying to <strong>break</strong>.
            So let me tell you a little story, about someone motivated towards their goal.</p>

            <p>The wake-up call this time was a motivational video I saw at school today. It is the <strong>whole reason</strong>
            I am here today, pushing forward towards my goals. Just <em>imagine</em> how skilled I will be after 1 year of this
            wonderful project!</p>

            <p>Even so, audience member, I have tried to push forward and stay confident <em>myriads</em> of times. The most 
            successful thing to come out of this is my "<em>journal</em>". It has helped me know what to do when I am lost. And 
            <strong>that</strong> is what I need to do to <em>really</em> change things around here. Setting up 
            <strong>regimented</strong> systems has helped me keep from sliding back into the <em>hypnotic glow</em> of the screen.
            I have lost <em>years</em> of my time, slaving away all to make some tech billionaire a few bucks richer. No more.</p>

            <!--P.S. If you are reading this, I am having a lot of fun writing this!! 
            Also, this is my second ever comment! Yippee!!-->

            <p>But of course, this is a double sided coin. Another equally effective method of <strong>changing my life</strong> is
            cutting out the forces rotting it away. For example, I recently sliced down the time dragon known as, 
            "<strong>Youtube</strong>". No longer will it hold the wealth (time) that I have <em>forsaken</em> for so long.
            Soon, I will identify and destroy many more <strong>threats</strong> to my well-being.</p>

            <p>The motivational video (that I mentioned earlier) said that I should choose one goal and work towards it for
            <strong>90 days</strong>. And to be honest, 90 days isn't <i>really</i> that long; especially if I think about how much
            time I spent <strong>wasting away</strong> in front of the screen that was meant to <em>help me</em>.
            </p>

            <p>And so, the conclusion. To be honest, I don't <em>really</em> know how to end this message. Because it isn't 
            <em>really</em> the end, it's only the beginning. Thanks for reading this webpage, and here's to a 
            better year in 2025!!</p>

            <p><em>P.S. The video also told me to imagine what the future might look like. The image of a successful me,
            5 years later, will help keep me going. How are you, future-me? I hope you're doing better, at the very least.</em>
